In tutorial example HelloNode.py a Node is introduced.

Nodes, rather than views, are the centerpiece of Eden (Event driven evaluation nodes).
They facilitate

<ul>
<li> Dynamic behaviour (shown in this example)
<li> Functional dependencies (shown later)
</ul>

Furthermore

<ul>
<li> The centrally located CLabelView is replaced by a TextView.
<li> Four CLabelViews are positioned around it.
Their text value follows the value of the TextView, since they are connected to the same Node instance.
<li> FillerViews are inserted before the top and bottom CLabelViews.
This causes the top and bottom CLabelViews to be in the centre column of the GridView,
rather than in the left column.
</ul>

If you edit the contents of the TextView, you'll see the caption and the labels change after you press [Enter].

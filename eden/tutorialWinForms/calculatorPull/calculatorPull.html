In tutorial example CalculatorPull "Event Only" Nodes are introduced.
An "Event Only" Node, or briefly Event Node, is a Node that always has value None.
Its task in life is to propagate events rather than values.

<ol>
<li> First, the event associated with pressing the +, -, * or / button travels to resultNode.
<li> In reaction, resultNode calls its getter function getResult, that will compute the new value of resultNode.
</ol>

Making Nodes communicate by connecting them through a call to Node.dependsOn, is called the Pull pattern.
Use of the Pull pattern is not restricted to Event Nodes.
Any Node can be in the list of event source Nodes that is passed to Node.dependsOn.
And any Node can be used in implementing the getter function that is passed to Node.dependsOn.
Underlying the Pull pattern is an elaborated version of the Observer pattern.
By attaching an internal version number to events, and making available the previous Subject state in Node.old, 
repeated and cyclic updates that often plague Observer applications, are completely avoided.

<p>
Remark: By convention, all names of Event Nodes start with the prefix "do".

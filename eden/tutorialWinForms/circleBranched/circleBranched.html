In CircleBranched the update graph is defined by

<ul>
<li> perimeterNode | areaNode -> radiusNode
<li> radiusNode -> perimeterNode
<li> radiusNode -> areaNode
</ul>

The update graph now has two cycles

<ul>
<li> perimeterNode->radiusNode->perimeterNode
<li> areaNode->radiusNode->areaNode
</ul>

Since one of the cycles may not contain the Trigger Node, recursion is stopped explicitly by a test in getRadius.
While this accounts for some extra code, the formulation of dependencies now looks more natural than with the single cycle update graph.

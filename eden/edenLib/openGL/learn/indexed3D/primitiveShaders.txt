Lines can always be joined if they have a half round top.
The whole line including the tops can be drawn using a line loop.
The most 3D way of drawing lines is making them cilinders with a half spherical top.
They will then be drawn in perspective.

Viewed as such, lines are an example of a 3D primitive.
So a collection of 3D primitives is needed, than can be arbitrarily position in space.

Beam, Cilinder and Sphere should do, if the primitives are allowed to intersect.
But that wastes time and space.
